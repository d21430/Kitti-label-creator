# Kitti-label-creator
A tool to easily create kitti labels for deep learning.


This is a simple tool writen in C# (With a loot of bugs and a terrible structure) that is created with the purpose of helping to create Deep Learning data bases based on the Kitti format.

New changes to be uploaded with a more stable structure and bugs fixed. All collaboration is welcome.

Writen by David Astorga.
